# InternetGameGraphics
Game coded from scratch in Java as my final project for Honors Intro to CS 2. Allows the user to choose the game graphics to use via a Google Search. Note that the custom search engine used was free and only allows 100 requests per day; the game needs 5 requests per run, leaving only 20 runs per day if you wish to try it.

The game is a simple one-on-one battle; if you touch the enemy, you lose health, while if the enemy is hit by your (potentially very creative) weapon, the enemy loses health. Use the arrow keys to move, up to jump (hold down to jump higher), and space to attack.

The game also notifies the user of certain events, such as hits/loss of health or temporary immunity directly after being hit, in the console/terminal, so it is suggested that you drag the terminal off to the side while the main game frame is loading.

Close the window to exit the game.
