# InternetGameGraphics
Game coded from scratch in Java as my final project for Honors Intro to CS 2. Allows the user to choose the game graphics to use via a Google Search. Note that the custom search engine used was free and only allows 100 requests per day; the game needs 5 requests per run, leaving only 20 runs per day if you wish to try it.
